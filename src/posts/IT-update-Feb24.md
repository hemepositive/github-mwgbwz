### PSO vs. Transfer Patient vs. Change Attending To

There have been ongoing problems with providers canceling PSOs. The cancellation of a PSO has significant background effects in Cerner. The following points are for clarification:

**PSO**: Patient Status Order. A PSO is needed to establish patient status for every admission to inpatient or observation. You SHOULD NOT cancel a PSO order; only case management should adjust PSO.

**Transfer Patient Order**: Use this to transfer a patient to a different unit. A new PSO is not needed.

**Change attending to**: Use this order to change the attending physician. A new PSO is not needed.

**Cosign PSO**: Please right-click on PSO order to cosign if unable to discharge pending a co-signature by any physician.

### Helen Keller & Red Bay Cerner Go-Live this weekend

The Huntsville Hospital IT staff have been working on the Helen Keller Red Bay Cerner expansion for some time. I am pleased to announce that this weekend is Go-Live. While the 3 Madison County hospitals have been on our single instance of Cerner/1Chart since day 1, expanding to include 2 more hospitals is a big step for our hospital system. After stabilization, the plan is to add the two Marshal hospitals to Cerner/1Chart.
