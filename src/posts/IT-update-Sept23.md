### Helen Keller and Red Bay Cerner update

The IT team's primary efforts are working toward adding Helen Keller to our instance of Cerner. As this build progresses, we add Helen Keller patients to our production database. These patients have medical record numbers starting with "03". For now, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE ignore patients with MRNs beginning with 03.

### Pharmacy - Therapeutic Substitution Medications

Pharmacy wanted providers to know how to order therapeutic equivalents when no pre-defined therapeutic substitution ("t-sub") exists in Cerner. Providers commonly encounter this during initial admission medication reconciliation.
