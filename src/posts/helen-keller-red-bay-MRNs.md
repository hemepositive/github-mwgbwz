### Update from IT Leadership

Starting as early as August 28, 2023, you will begin to see patients in 1Chart with medical record numbers starting with “03”. These patients from Helen Keller and Red Bay hospitals will begin to be preloaded into 1Chart. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE ignore these records. Initially, the only information that will be loaded is demographics. There will be no visits against these records initially. Over time, additional information will be loaded.

Please ignore these records when choosing a patient record for scheduling, registration, ordering, charging, resulting, or documentation purposes. If you are doing a lookup and the only patient match you can find is an “03” number, please ignore it. Even if the patient has never been seen at any Madison County facilities, and you are certain that this is the patient, ignore the “03” number, and create a new medical record number for that patient. Using these numbers before Helen Keller or Red Bay are live on Cerner could have negative implications for patient care now or in the future. Where duplicate MRNs are created, we will resolve those after go-live.

When Helen Keller and Red Bay Hospitals are fully implemented, you will be granted full access to these patients as we begin to more completely realize the vision of “1 Patient, 1 Chart” across northern Alabama. But until that declaration is given, PLEASE ignore these “03” records.

If you have any questions about this, please contact Sharon Davis, Walter Willis, Michael Blank or Rick Corn.
