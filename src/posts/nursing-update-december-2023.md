We are ending our year on a good note; nursing turnover is down, and we are working on several projects for stabilization and growth.

- We graduated 11 LPN students from our LPN Launch program and over 70 nursing apprentices house-wide currently.
- To date, we have hired 766 bedside nurses.
- Human Resources began tracking nursing 1-year turnover. (If you are hired today, are you still here next year on the same date). National 1-year RN turnover is 32%, and HH is 23%.
- One strategy to impact 1-year turnover is requiring all new graduates to attend our Nurse Residency Program, which mentors and supports our nurses in their first year, which will start in 2024.
- Nursing Clinical Ladder participants doubled this year. 618 nurses participated compared to 306 in 2022. The clinical ladder monetarily compensates nurses for their work towards teaching classes, mentoring a student, advancing degrees, and participating in committees and community projects.

#### Virtual Nursing project on 7N/NE/NW continues to prove successful.

- Zero falls from patients being monitored by virtual sitters
- 55% of admissions, 80% of discharges, and 50-70% of patient education are completed by virtual nurses.
