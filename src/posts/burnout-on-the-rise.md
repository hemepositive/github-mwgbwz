### Burnout: "long-term, unresolved, job-related stress leading to exhaustion, cynicism, detachment from job responsibilities, and lacking a sense of personal accomplishment."[^1]

Last summer, Medscape surveyed 9000+ physicians for the latest [Medscape Physician Burnout & Depression Report](https://www.medscape.com/slideshow/2023-lifestyle-burnout-6016058). Not surprisingly, burnout increased significantly during the COVID years, with 53% of all surveyed expressing burnout\*. Below are the specialties with > 50% incidence of burnout.

- Emergency medicine — 65 percent of physicians reported burnout

- Infectious diseases — 58 percent
- Family medicine — 57 percent

Even if the numbers for the Huntsville Hospital medical staff are better than this, many of us no longer feel the joy and satisfaction we once did. The long hours, intense workload, emotional strain, and constant exposure to critical situations can gradually take a toll on our mental, emotional, and physical health. Recognizing burnout as a valid concern is the first step toward finding practical solutions. I encourage you to reflect on your well-being and observe any warning signs indicating burnout. These signs can manifest in various ways, such as increased exhaustion, decreased empathy, emotional detachment, reduced job satisfaction, or even physical symptoms like headaches or insomnia. Identifying and acknowledging these symptoms is essential to take proactive steps to mitigate their impact. Burnout may lead to decreased empathy, poor decision-making, and medical errors. Therefore, it is crucial that you take care of yourselves and prioritize your mental health.
