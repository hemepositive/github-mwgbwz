The Huntsville Hospital Medical Executive Committee wanted to update you on pending Cerner changes that will improve the visibility of clinical documents. These changes are needed to allow community providers to view Cerner clinical documents, labs, imaging, and tests done at all HHÂ facilities. The current settings prevent office staff from accessing data tied to an encounter outside of Huntsville Hospital (including HH for Women and Children and Madison Hospital). This results in some providers' office staff not being able to view ECHOs done at HH Heart Center, PFTs done at HH Lung Center, etc. Patients can see their records through the patient portal, so increasing the visibility of these documents to include physician office staff is a minor change.
Please don't hesitate to contact me with any issues or concerns.
