The recently updated Transfer of Patients policy has been updated and clarifies the need for transfer medication reconciliation. This change will affect your workflow but increases patient safety. The revised policy instructs nurses to “Verify that all medication orders are current, reviewed. and updated by the provider as indicated”. The receiving nurses are to contact the provider if this still needs to be completed. Don't hesitate to get in touch with me with any questions.

Below is a tip sheet on how to perform transfer medication reconciliation. The IT team can help anyone needing more instruction on performing this reconciliation.
