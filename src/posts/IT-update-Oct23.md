### Remote Access

Remote access is available for all providers who use 1Chart/Cerner. The two options are tunneling through a VPN or mobile access with PowerChart Touch and Cerner Message Center App.

&nbsp; 1. VPN - <a aria-label="Open PDF file" href="/files/1Chart_Remote_Access_Instructions.pdf">Remote Access Instuctions</a>

&nbsp; 2. Mobile - there are two separate apps used to access 1Chart/Cerner remotely. PowerChart Touch gives access to your patient's chart. This app is most helpful in accessing labs, imaging reports, and documentation. The Cerner Message Center app gives you access to your Message Center. You can install both apps through your phone's app store, but they require a token to be active. Contact the Phys Track team through the help desk at ext. 5-7777 or email physician.help.line@hhsys.org to get an access code.

### Adding images to a patient's chart

Cerner provides two free mobile apps that allow providers to add images to a patient's chart: PowerChart Touch, which has an imaging function, and Cerner Camera Capture. These apps enable capturing pictures of wounds, rashes, etc., and uploads to our database. The images are then available for viewing on the desktop app for all users. Both apps are available for both iOS and Android but require a token to be activated. If you are interested in these apps, contact the Phys Track team through the Help Desk at ext. 5-7777 or email physician.help.line@hhsys.org.

### Accessing hospital WiFi

The best way to access 1Chart/Cerner or the internet on their smartphones is over the "HHDOCS" WiFi connection. Call the Help Desk at ext. 5-7777 to set up an appointment for enabling your device to access HHDOCS.

### Wolters-Kluwer Sepsis Monitor

I am pleased to announce that we will change from the Cerner sepsis tool to the Wolter-Kluwer Sentri7 Sepsis Monitor in early 2024. This software is a significant upgrade, and we anticipate fewer sepsis alerts with higher specificity with this tool.

### Dragon Microphones and Physicians' PCs

Several physicians noted the need for more Dragon mics. These microphones cost about $350 each, so we cannot add them to every PC. We are purchasing more mics and adding to several computers throughout the more widely used clinical areas. Contact Karol Jones (256)348-7515 if you know of a specific workstation that could benefit from a Dragon mic.

As a reminder, four PCs are available near the physicians' parking lot entrance. These workstations have Dragon mics and are often unoccupied. This area is a good option for those wanting another private location to use the EMR.
