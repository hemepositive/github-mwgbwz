### GI and VTE Prophylaxis Re-assessments

A key aspect of preventing stress ulcers and VTE is constant reassessment. A significant safety concern is missing an opportunity to start prophylaxis days or weeks into hospitalization. The Cerner VTE Advisor triggers on admission, not on day 15, and there is no reminder for GI prophylaxis. Please be mindful of the need to change a patientâ€™s GI or VTE prophylaxis based on their current clinical situation.
