### Want the easiest free CME ever?

Huntsville Hospital provides access to Up To Date, which allows providers to get free CME if they use a personal account on a computer on the HH network. Since each search is considered point-of-care, “UpToDate designates this Internet point\-of\-care activity for a maximum of 0.5 AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)™. Physicians should claim only credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.” Over a year, the queries can add up to many CME credits.
To access this benefit, you must create a personal login with UpToDate. Once you have a personal account, simply log in to UpToDate using a HH computer or wifi network.

### Maintaining Access

To maintain uninterrupted access to UpToDate, you must re-verify your affiliation with your organization once every 90 days. Re-verifying can be done using either of the options listed below.

- Access UpToDate via your organization's EHR or portal at least once every 90 days. This will automatically re-verify your affiliation, and you will not receive any re-verification messaging. This method requires no UpToDate.com log in.
- Log into UpToDate by going to <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.uptodate.com">UpToDate</a> from a computer connected to your organization's network. This method requires you to log in to UpToDate.
